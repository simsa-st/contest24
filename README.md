# Contest24
This library provides useful tools for 24-hour programming competitions like
Marathon24, Deadline24 and others.

## Compiling
To compile this library you will need cmake. Then you need to install SFML
(https://github.com/SFML/SFML).

After that you can just build using cmake (but not in the root directory!).
From the root directory, run:
<pre>
<code>$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
</code></pre>

In the <code>build/bin/</code> directory you will find compiled examples.
