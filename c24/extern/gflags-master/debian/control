Description: Google's Commandline flags module for C++
 The gflags package contains a library that implements commandline flags 
 processing. As such it's a replacement for getopt(). It has increased 
 flexibility, including built-in support for C++ types like string, and
 the ability to define flags in the source file in which they're used.
